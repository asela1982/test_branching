There is a HUGE sign that says Gate 19, Shelby Farms. If you are at Lowes, head north. If you are at Wal-Mart or Trinity. head south.</p> <p><br/><b>What to Bring:</b></p> <p>Bring snacks, water, sunscreen, and a hat. Wear either sneakers or hiking boots and dress in layers. It is also good to bring a backpack if you wish to remove layers. Bring bug spray. This is an easy hike on well marked trails, perfect for those new to hiking. We hike between 2-4 hours. If you go the whole way out and back, it is just over 7 miles. We usually break into at least two groups (those going all the way and those going part), so don't feel like you have to do the whole 7 miles.</p> <p><b>The Park:</b></p> <p>Lucius Burch Natural Area is a 728-acre natural area located in Germantown and Shelby County and is a part of a larger 6,000-acre county park. The natural area is a remnant of historic river meanders, bald cypress-water tupelo swamps, bottomland hardwood forests, and open river channel habitat. Unfortunately, much of this ecosystem has been significantly altered as a result of change in hydrology and the invasion of common privet, an invasive exotic pest plant. Lucius Burch Natural Area offers passive recreation activities such as day hiking, bird watching, and wildlife viewing within the metropolitan Memphis area.</p> <p><b>Directions:</b></p> <p>The parking lot we meet at is just south of Germantown and Walnut Grove.

We sincerely appreciate everyone’s support of and interest in the FIBI and we look forward to seeing you at the event.</p> <p>This event will be held in the usual FIBI philosophy of providing informal meeting environments without any sales pitch whatsoever with the goal of helping investors to network with and learn from others. Unlike other FIBI meetings and due to the large attendees that we expect, this meeting will not include a speaker or panel discussion but will simply be an informal networking event to help celebrate the holidays.  Please note that there will be a $30 cover charge payable in cash at the door to help cover the costs of the event center, as our goal is to break-even while providing everyone with a great night of networking.</p> <p>Come, enjoy the food and drinks, network with like-minded investors and develop all of the resources you need to be a successful real estate investor this year. </p> <p><b>We look forward to seeing as many of our FIBI members as possible on December 7th to help celebrate the holidays!</b></p> <p><img src=""https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/a/a/9/600_466047305.jpeg"" /></p>",23.934978485107425,,https://www.meetup.com/forinvestorsbyinvestors/events/245004926/,,,,,,,1251943990000,33.830001831054695,-118.18000030517578,1517307,open,FIBI - Real Estate Investors Unite - Long Beach,forinvestorsbyinvestors,Investors,0,,245004926,0,Over 300 RSVP’s Expected! 2017 FIBI ALL-CHAPTER HOLIDAY NETWORKING EVENT,,,upcoming,1512700200000,1510346136000,-28800000,4101 East Willow Street,,,Long Beach,us,7011122.0,33.804237,USA,-118.147377,The Grand Long Beach Event Center,,False,CA,90815,public,0,,66,2017-12-07 20:30:00,4,error

<b>Surya Kriya</b> is a potent yoga of tremendous antiquity, designed as a holistic process for health, wellness, and complete inner well-being. “Surya” means “sun,” and “kriya” means “inner energy process.” Surya Kriya activates the solar plexus to raise thesamat prana, or solar heat, in the system. It also balances a person’s left and right energy channels, leading to stability of the body and stillness of the mind. This strong foundation becomes the basis to explore higher dimensions of life.</p> <p>Traditionally available only to select groups of yogis, Surya Kriya is being offered by Sadhguru as a comprehensive spiritual practice that is ideal for the hectic pace of today’s world.</p> <p>This is a hatha yoga program (physical postures) which will be taught step-by-step and guided by a teacher trained in India by Sadhguru. Once you have completed the program, you can practice on your own at home. Surya Kriya does not require previous experience with yoga.</p> <p><b>Benefits:</b></p> <p>- Develops mental clarity and focus</p> <p>- Remedies weak constitutions</p> <p>- Boosts vigor and vitality</p> <p>- Balances hormonal levels in the body</p> <p>- Prepares one for deeper states of meditation</p> <p><a href=""https://www.ishafoundation.org/us/event-registration/?ee=1905""><a href=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/xIxqtlDDt7D2KnUu3Q17zZdb-VSTA6B81lfEdKjkppenPpll1QnEEKosWLtihkAqW-rgCLcGCs7sGCkT3d_mDYulWSRhvLQEeCejLOQuoyt8cyD0oo0zegfCi7KdZIbtKnjMbWZr"" class=""linkified"">https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/xIxqtlDDt7D2KnUu3Q17zZdb-VSTA6B81lfEdKjkppenPpll1QnEEKosWLtihkAqW-rgCLcGCs7sGCkT3d_mDYulWSRhvLQEeCejLOQuoyt8cyD0oo0zegfCi7KdZIbtKnjMbWZr</a></a></p>",15.840582847595215,99000000.0,https://www.meetup.com/IshaYogaPhiladelphia/events/244608226/,,,,,,,1454786345000,40.11999893188477,-75.01000213623047,19525091,open,Inner Engineering Philly  (Isha Yoga & Meditation Classes),IshaYogaPhiladelphia,Meditators,0,,244608226,0,Surya Kriya: Fire up the Sun Within (Isha Hatha Yoga),,,upcoming,1513431000000,1509221417000,-18000000,205 Mary St,,,Carnegie,us,25009504.0,40.408154,USA,-80.08726999999998,Cafe Delhi and Karma Banquet Event Hall,,False,PA,15106,public,0,,4,2017-12-16 07:30:00,6,health/wellbeing

We can walk around the park to capture lots of pretty holiday lights and reflections.  Wear warm clothing and shoes!</p> <p><br/><b>What is Bokeh exactly?</b></p> <p>Bokeh comes from the Japanese term boke, which means blur (properly pronounced as bouquet).  In Photography, it refers to the quality of the blur in out of focus ares of an image.....or.....the way the lens renders out of focus points of light.  You can have good or bad bokeh but it is subjective to the viewer.  Some may see bokeh as pleasing or distracting.</p> <p><b>How to achieve Bokeh:</b></p> <p>A shallow depth of field from your lens creates bokeh naturally and it is most visible around small background highlights.  Smaller light sources and reflections yield great results in all out of focus areas of an image, in daylight through tree leaves for example, or more obviously found in the evening.  Christmas tree lights are a perfect example of a great way to create Bokeh!  You've probably created bokeh a zillion times already!</p> <p><b>A few quick Bokeh Tips:</b></p> <p><b>1.  Lens.</b></p> <p>It's all about the lens.  You will need a fairly wide aperture (f1.4 - f2.8) to allow the extra light.  Shooting at a large (wide open) aperture blurs &amp; throws your background out of focus.  The larger the aperture the more rounded the bokeh effect.  If you want a hexagonal shape to your bokeh, then step down your aperture.  Nearly any lens does have the potential to create a bokeh effect at it's widest aperture.</p> <p>- 50mm 1.4 or 1.8</p> <p>- macro lens (preferably 2.8)</p> <p>- portrait lens such as 85mm 1.8 or 2.8</p> <p>- any other lens with a large aperture such as 2.8</p> <p>- telephoto lens (use your widest aperture)</p> <p>I promise....no matter your lens, we can get this effect for you!!</p> <p><b>2.  Manual focus.</b> This allows the most versatility in the appearance of the bokeh effect on the lights, such as how large or sharp they are.</p> <p><b>3.  Distance.</b></p> <p>The distance between your ""focused subject"" and your background lights will make a difference on the size of the background bokeh effect on the lights.  For example:  If you wish to have a sharp subject in the foreground and large blurred lights in the background, you will want to increase the distance between the two (meaning your subject and the background lights).  This is especially effective for people shots.  Experiment with putting the lights in the foreground and your subject in the background too!</p> <p><b>4.  Shapes.</b></p> <p>Create shapes by using a ""mask"" of the shape over your lens.  Use a cereal box to experiment with a few shapes ;)    This image was taken with a 105mm f2.8 macro lens using a heart mask:</p> <p><img src=""http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/0/a/a/event_183508842.jpeg"" /></p> <p><b>5.  Tripod.</b></p> <p>It's not necessary of course, but it will allow you to keep your camera stationary and keep your framing while you experiment and play with focus &amp; aperture adjustments. It's a good idea especially in the cold where your hands/body may tremble.</p> <p><b>What to bring:</b></p> <p>Tripod</p> <p>keep an extra battery warm in your pocket</p> <p>hot cocoa to keep you warm</p> <p>*<i>Remember when shooting outside in the cold weather to protect your camera from building condensation when bringing it indoors.  Let it come to temperature in slow increments if possible.  Those silica packets are perfect to absorb any condensation in your bag and are very readily available and free!</i></p>",15.122389793395994,7200000.0,https://www.meetup.com/tcrpmg/events/245646767/,,,,,,,1226376680000,42.68999862670898,-73.83000183105469,1318996,open,Capital Region Photography Meetup Group,tcrpmg,Photographic Artists,0,Meet us by the Moses Fountain - CLICK THE WASHINGTON PARK link for MAP under place/location.,245646767,0,Bokeh & Holiday Lights Photo Walk,,,upcoming,1513726200000,1512418627000,-18000000,"Washington Park, Albany, NY",,,Albany,us,6794092.0,42.658356,USA,-73.772789,"Washington Park, Albany, NY",,False,Ne,,public,0,,12,2017-12-19 17:30:00,2,photography

All levels have hills; terrain is sometimes steep with uneven footing. <b>Because hikers are expected to maintain the pace set by hike leaders, newcomers should not hike above level 3 and may wish to start at level 2. </b>While <b>multiple hike levels are offered simultaneously</b>, some levels may not be offered on a given evening.

Hikes begin at 7pm; <i>newcomers should get there early to fill out a waiver and should carry the waiver card with them on the hikes.</i></p> <p><b>What to bring</b>: Bring water and a light jacket in case it gets cold. Hiking boots/shoes are necessary for the harder hikes (levels 3-5) and are strongly encouraged for all hikes; tennis shoes with good tread may be sufficient for the more moderate hikes (levels 1 &amp; 2). Flashlights are optional; many leaders discourage their use except in emergencies. If flashlights are used, red lights are preferable as they interfere less with night vision.

The Dancer's Workout is not a beginner's dance class; it requires training in ballet, jazz, or hip hop and the ability to pick up choreography quickly.  Every version of The Dancer's Workout includes movement sequences from multiple genres of dance, including ballet, lyrical jazz, hip-hop, and contemporary.  Its instructional choreography builds upon itself throughout the hour and offers a powerful, non-stop cardio workout which culminates in a dance to a featured pop song. The class is great for former dancers who want to find their way back home and for active dancers interested in maintaining flexibility and cardio stamina.  Jazz sneakers or jazz slippers preferred.</p> <p>Jules is a classical ballet graduate of the University of North Carolina School of the Arts who teaches The Dancer's Workout® at various locations throughout the triangle.

Think Ted Talks on steroids and more random.</p> <p><br/>PKNs are very popular so they can be quite crowded. They also don't announce the location until about a month out, so look for the update.

This class has been so popular in the past that it will now be given twice in one week. You can choose to attend the event either on <b>Thursday, January 25</b>, or on <b>Sunday, January 28</b>. Each event has an attendance limit of 45 members or guests permitted to register. Both classes take place from 1:30 to 3:30 PM.</p> <p><img src=""https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/5/7/a/600_463405978.jpeg"" /></p> <p>During these seminars we'll be surrounded by <b>hundreds of orchids</b>, many of which are rare varieties. Jerry and his wife Sharon have been raising and selling magnificent orchids for years, and can answer all our questions. At our last event there a year ago, our more experienced gardeners requested an advanced class so that they could raise some of the rarely seen orchids that have recently come on the market. These two classes are ideal for those members, but they will also include basic orchid cultivation instructions for all beginners.</p> <p><img src=""https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/5/9/6/600_463406006.jpeg"" /></p> <p>We'll be discussing which varieties should be planted in soil or a range of potting mixes, and which others require nothing around their roots. Many can simply be mounted on the branches of trees or attached to walls, or have their roots contained in (or overflowing out of) slotted wooden boxes. We'll talk about clay vs. plastic pots, organic vs. chemical fertilizers, various pesticides, trimming roots, dividing plants, light requirements, and any other orchid-cultivation topics that members bring up. Most orchids growing in south Florida's semi-tropical environment need very little care, yet provide great beauty in our homes and gardens.</p> <p><img src=""https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/5/a/2/600_463406018.jpeg"" /></p> <p>These seminars will be held in one of Jerry's screened greenhouses. Very little seating is available, so those who prefer to be seated are advised to bring along some folding chairs. Garden group members who don't know how to identify or divide or pot or revive an orchid they already have can <b>bring the plant to these classes</b> for professional help. Members can also purchase orchids and accessories here, and take advantage of the generous <b>15% discount</b> given to members of our group.</p> <p><img src=""https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/5/a/9/600_463406025.jpeg"" /></p> <p>After each class, Jerry will give us a guided tour around the nursery, where we can admire and learn about the hundreds of varieties of orchids displayed there. His <a href=""http://www.orchidsamore.com""><b>Orchids Amore</b></a> web site includes an ever-growing photo gallery of over 3,200 varieties of orchids identified by name. As usual at our events, members can bring along their favorite foods and drinks to share with others during the traditional <b>snack-and-chat</b> portion of the class. And those who bring their excess plants for the <b>free plant-exchange</b> table can take other plants home for their own gardens.</p> <p><img src=""https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/5/c/1/600_463406049.jpeg"" /></p> <p>To let our hosts (and your friends in our group) know whether you will or won't attend either the Thursday class or the Sunday class, register your intent by clicking on the green <b>RSVP</b> panel near the upper right corner of the screen, and select either <i>Yes</i> or <i>No</i>.

Now almost 10 years later, I've built a portfolio valued at $7.5mm. My partner has a portfolio of almost 1,400 units (thanks to partners), Ryan from Cushman &amp; Wakefield has access to off-market deals and Robert has access to high net-worth and institutional real estate investors. </p> <p>Just like my group of partners, you can also overcome challenges of lack of capital, weak financial strength, lack of knowledge, gain access to off-market deals, remove fear of failure and inability to take that next step. </p> <p>So far we are doing a great job. Many partners are working on a 10-70 unit deals. Our relationships were leveraged to find off-market deals and help with fund raising (equity and debt).

My partners have. They are pursuing off-market deals in major markets and building their portfolios. The key to their success is finding the right partners. They gain confidence, capital, knowledge, financial strength and get rid of fear.</p> <p>I started my journey as a 23 year old and have partners. Now almost 10 years later, I've built a portfolio valued at $7.5mm. My partner has a portfolio of almost 1,400 units (thanks to partners), Ryan from Cushman &amp; Wakefield has access to off-market deals and Robert has access to high net-worth and institutional real estate investors. </p> <p>Just like my group of partners, you can also overcome challenges of lack of capital, weak financial strength, lack of knowledge, gain access to off-market deals, remove fear of failure and inability to take that next step. </p> <p>So far we are doing a great job. Many partners are working on a 10-70 unit deals. Our relationships were leveraged to find off-market deals and help with fund raising (equity and debt).

To get a better understanding, we will discuss mobile communication with the cloud and hardware to get a picture of how mobile can act as a bridge between the two.</p> <p>Second, we will create an application with Azure Web Apps and Azure Mobile Apps to create a website to interact with our mobile device. Through it we will set rules and send messages to and from the mobile application. Those messages will then be used to interact with the devices over Bluetooth Low Energy.</p> <p>Third, we will create a Bluetooth Low Energy device that interacts with peripherals as they send and receive messages from the mobile application.

1507159160000,"<p>Our meetings help to open blocked energy, and allow the healing energy to move. The important thing in Qi Gong active exercises is learning to move the energy in and around you body for healing and well being.</p> <p>Suggested donation $10- $15.00. $75 for 10 sessions prepaid.</p> <p>By combining principles of Mindfulness with Qigong, a synergy is achieved the help the free flow of energy in the body.</p> <p>For more information on our style of Qi Gong visit www.springforestgigong.com</p> <p>Qigong is a powerful system of healing and energy medicine from China. Qi means ""Life-force energy"" and gong means ""skill,"" so Qigong (pronounced Chigong) is the skillful practice of gathering, circulating, and applying life-force energy. It uses breathing techniques, gentle movement, and meditation to cleanse, strengthen, and circulate the life energy or Qi and leads to better health and vitality and a tranquil state of mind.</p> <p>The primary goal is to purge toxic emotions from within the body's tissues, eliminate energetic stagnation's, as well as strengthen and balance the internal organs and energetic fields.</p> <p>All living bodies generate an external field of energy. This energy originates from each of the internal organs and radiates through the external tissues. This field of Qi protects the body from the invasion of external pathogens and communicates with, as well as interacts with, the surrounding universal and environmental energy fields.</p> <p>Both internal and external pathogenic factors affect the structural formation of the Qi. The internal factors include suppressed emotional influences (such as anger and grief from emotional traumas). The external factors include environmental influences when they are too severe or chronic, such as Cold, Damp, Heat or Wind, etc. Physical traumas also affect the Qi field.</p> <p>Any negative interchange affects the Wei Qi by literally creating holes within the matrix of the individual's external energetic fields. When left unattended, these holes leave the body vulnerable to penetration, and disease begins to take root in the body. Strong emotions, in the form of toxic energy, become trapped within the body's tissues when we hold back or do not integrate our feelings. These unprocessed emotions block the natural flow of Qi, thus creating stagnant pools of toxic energy within the body.</p> <p>The body has an energy field that is composed of energetic lines called meridians and channels. Energetic blockages in these channels cause imbalances in the energy field, which can lead to dis-ease. A free flow of energy is needed in the body and energy system for good health and well-being.</p> <p>Medical Qigong consists of specific techniques that uses the knowledge of the body's internal and external energy fields to purge, tonify, and balance these energies. Medical Qigong therapy offers patients a safe and effective way to rid themselves of toxic pathogens and years of painful emotions that otherwise, can cause mental and physical illness. This therapy combines breathing techniques with movement, creative visualization, and spiritual intent to improve health, personal power, and control over one's own life.</p> <p>For more information on our style of Qi Gong visit www.springforestqigong.com (<a href=""http://www.springforestqigong.com/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.springforestqigong.com/</a>)</p> <p>Testamonials</p> <p>Allergies (<a href=""http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#1"" class=""linkified"">http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#1</a>)</p> <p>Seasonal Allergies (<a href=""http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#1"" class=""linkified"">http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#1</a>)</p> <p>Arthritis (<a href=""http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#4"" class=""linkified"">http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#4</a>)</p> <p>Brain Stem Bleeding (<a href=""http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#5"" class=""linkified"">http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#5</a>)</p> <p>Cancer (<a href=""http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#6)Breast"" class=""linkified"">http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#6)Breast</a> Stage (<a href=""http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#8)4"" class=""linkified"">http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#8)4</a></p> <p>Lymphoma Stage 4 (<a href=""http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#9"" class=""linkified"">http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#9</a>)</p> <p>Chronic Pain -Neck Injury (<a href=""http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#10"" class=""linkified"">http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#10</a>)</p> <p>Fibromyalgia (<a href=""http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#11"" class=""linkified"">http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#11</a>)</p> <p>Delta Wave Sleep (<a href=""http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#12"" class=""linkified"">http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#12</a>)</p> <p>Insomnia (<a href=""http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#13"" class=""linkified"">http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#13</a>)</p> <p>Lung Disease (<a href=""http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#14"" class=""linkified"">http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#14</a>)</p> <p>Multiple Sclerosis (<a href=""http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#15"" class=""linkified"">http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#15</a>)</p> <p>Mental Clarity (<a href=""http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#16"" class=""linkified"">http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#16</a>)</p> <p>Migraine Headaches (<a href=""http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#17"" class=""linkified"">http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#17</a>)</p> <p>Macular Degeneration (<a href=""http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#18"" class=""linkified"">http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#18</a>)</p> <p>Pain – From Accident (<a href=""http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#19"" class=""linkified"">http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#19</a>)</p> <p>Parkinson’s Disease (<a href=""http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#20"" class=""linkified"">http://www.springforestqigong.com/index.php/testimonials#20</a>)</p> <p>

1510968164000,"<p>Hello Crafters!</p> <p>Since the last class was basically a catch up and free for all, this next class will begin to introduce the amazing world of art journaling.</p> <p>We will cover some of the reasons why art journaling has become such a fantastic creative outlet and so popular for all levels and ages.</p> <p>After a brief introduction to art journalling, we will decide as a team going forward exactly how we will ignite our own series of art journalling at Christel's Craft Therapy.</p> <p>I will supply all the art supplies needed to complete each series. Materials included are acrylic paints, markers, chalks, oils, pencils, stencils, stamps, decorative paper, ephemera, jewels, glue, and everything else needed to make this series a hit.</p> <p>Please bring a mixed media, blank page hardcover Journal of your choice. These journals can be purchased at Michael's and Hobby Lobby.</p> <p>If you were not able to attend the class where we embellished our front cover of our art journals, I will be having another class in the near future to do so. All you need to bring is the journals in Illustrated above so we can start our series. I decided that our first art journaling series will be focused on the basics and give us an opportunity to dabble in all the various forms of mixed media supplies.</p> <p>Each student will be given a certain amount and color of acrylic paint, water colors, micas, sprays, mediums, stencils, stencils, stamps, and so on. I just want everyone to get a good feel for some of the different techniques used when art journaling. Especially the layering techniqes.</p> <p>The class itself is $25 cash and should stay the same price if we continue to follow through with the art journaling series for the next few months.</p> <p>If you are not familiar with art journaling, I would suggest you do some research prior to class to ensure that this is a series you will want to take part in. I can promise you one thing, you will not be disappointed!</p> <p>Your mind, body and spirit are all yearning to we awakened to this amazing journey of self discovery, self exploration, restoration of the soul, childlike adventures, new creative outlooks and most importantly...to get out and have some fun with other amazing like minded artists and crafters.</p> <p>See you soon as we walk together towards new possibilities and creations.</p> <p>Namaste~</p> <p>Christel</p>",21.613994598388672,9000000.0,https://www.meetup.com/cre82calm/events/245199618/,,,,,,,1473433946000,27.28000068664551,-82.41000366210938,20406857,open,Craft Therapy Of Sarasota,cre82calm,Crafters,0,,245199618,0,Rescheduled!

Here is a short video in which Warren Buffet explains the value of his public speaking training:</p> <p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZEOCTApsLk"" class=""embedded"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZEOCTApsLk</a></p> <p><br/>As an entrepreneur, the ability to captivate an audience will translate into attracting more clients causing your business to soar to new heights. At this event, you will not only learn how to promote your business through platform presentations, you will also benefit from the sharp minds of other entrepreneurs that will put Napolean Hills master mind principle into full effect. Imagine an event where you come to master public speaking, marketing, and receive expert business coaching - all in ONE day! Our way of teaching is using advanced immersion techniques where you see, hear, and do so the concepts become ingrained and implemented for maximum retention.</p> <p>


Here is a video of one of my clients presenting on CNN:</p> <p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WpNJzHe9zE"" class=""embedded"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WpNJzHe9zE</a></p> <p><br/>What makes our training so effective is a unique blend of video feedback complimented with real time coaching designed to cut through the bad habits that have accumulated through the years. You will learn a unique systematic approach to public speaking, a patented system that's only taught by Atlanta Public Speaking. During the breakout session, we will cover:</p> <p>*Using The Bubble Map Instant Content Creator - Allowing you to design presentations in 30-45 min</p> <p>*Exploring key aspects of delivery from stage movement to knowing what to do with your hands</p> <p>*How to use storytelling, statistics, quotes, and analogies to make your message stand out</p> <p>*How to open effectively, build credibility, deliver quality content, and close in a powerful, persuasive way</p> <p>*How to engage the audience like a pro. Learn key strategies that the pros use to help the audience feel like they're a part of the presentation.</p> <p>Whether you are persuading colleagues, selling a client or energizing a team, the power of your presentation makes the difference between success and failure!</p> <p><b>*** This event is designed as a small group learning environment to allow plenty of practice time - Seating is Restricted and Extremely limited ***  </b></p> <p><b>I strongly recommend that you attend the workshop on Dec 9th!</b></p> <p>You will learn more about public speaking on Dec 9th then any previous training you've received on this topic, combined! I have been training professionals for years and I have been dubbed by different sources as ""the best public speaking coach in Atlanta""</p> <p>I have a strong passion to help people in this area as I used to struggle with stage fright all throughout my adolescent years. The best way to learn is through someone who has been in your shoes, yet found a way to rock crowds on the big stages! I have taught public speaking to executives from American Airlines, IBM, Hilti, Home Depot, Accenture, and many others - and on Dec 9th, I'd like to teach you through a special training entitled ""Presentation Skills Training - How to Use Public Speaking to Change Your Life"".  This is a presentation that I developed to help people learn and remember a lot in a very short period of time. It was designed as a break out session for a corporate conference that took place last month. I decided to offer it as a special for FREE to my wonderful members of Atlanta Public Speaking. It is very interactive and you will have a chance to speak that same day! This is the exact same presentation that I have taught at the corporate level for $1500/hr.</p> <p>Below is a video clip from a previous seminar:</p> <p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhR-lMyxsDU#t=11""><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhR-lMyxsDU#t=11"" class=""embedded"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhR-lMyxsDU#t=11</a></a></p> <p>Here's a testimonial from a GA Tech professional that has received his breakthrough after participating in the training:</p> <p><i>""It is with the greatest pleasure that l write this recommendation to Mr. Ariel Ghinga, CEO of the Personality Development Group, LLC. I came across an advertisement by Ariel when I was searching for expert advice and coaching to improve my professional and personal presentation and overall expression skills. The service provided by Ariel via one-on-one coaching sessions proved to be more than the monies’ worth. Ariel’s training, guidance and teaching caused a signiﬁcant transformation in my life. His methods helped me achieve much more than I expected: I was able to achieve my immediate career goals by implementing his approaches in real life situations.</i></p> <p><i>By just showing up for one of his demonstrations sessions, I was able to gauge what to expect and immediately signed up for his services. That was one of the smartest decisions I made in my life. I would highly recommend Ariel’s services to anyone who is looking to achieve his or her dream goals but is only restricted by the weaknesses or negative aspects of the personality. If you think you have some difficulties in expressing yourself or surviving under professional or normal social settings, Ariel would be the person to go for! He will guide you towards your goals, and teach you methods that will continuously keep you on track for nothing less than the ultimate success of your personal goals!""</i> – Chaminda M.

I came away with so much more insight than I previously had in the area of public speaking. Ariel has this way of making learning fun, so while I was gaining an understanding of how to use my tone of voice, hand gestures and attitude to grasp the crowd, I was yet having a ball. He has a natural way of making you feel comfortable in his presence and okay with making a few mistakes without feeling like an idiot. I absolutely loved this workshop and look forward to working with him in the near future to assist me in perfecting my speaking craft. Ariel has an awesome gift of teaching. He is a natural motivator and he has instilled a lot within me in just those 2 hours, Ariel is a gift.</p> <p>Like · Reply · December 19 · Mute</p> <p>John McCullough</p> <p>Very informative.

1512067803000,"<p>Oh my, it sure did get cold fast! We've got a LOT of rain in the forecast, but don't let that get you down, Northwest FPV is here to keep your race on! Never seen a drone race before? Come check it out! Seasoned pilot? Sign up! Freestyle guy who ""don't race""? oh please... sign up! The least that could happen is you get to hang out with a bunch of FPV folks for a couple hours and get a little stick time.</p> <p><br/>Just come fly and enjoy this amazing hobby and sport that we live in!</p> <p>Spectators, come on out and watch or fly these high-performance racing drones around a fast but challenging course. See below for venue amenities and details. WHEN:</p> <p>Sunday, December 10th @ 11:30am to 4pm</p> <p>WHERE:</p> <p>Oregon Equestrian Center</p> <p>28250 SW Petes Mountain Rd, West Linn, Oregon 97068</p> <p>Pilots, here's your info:</p> <p>* Simply purchase the item on <a href=""http://store.nwfpv.com"" class=""linkified"">http://store.nwfpv.com</a> and you will be entered into the race by a Northwest FPV Organizer. You will then receive an email with the MultiGP event link and all of the information you'll need (if this product description isn't enough). ** If you are a NWFPV paying member, the item will be discounted appropriately when added to your shopping cart. If you're a full member, select ""Free Checkout"" upon checkout.</p> <p>* Spectators are free - bring your friends, family, and kids</p> <p>Pilot Restrictions:</p> <p>* All participating pilots are required to hold a current AMA registration. (Full membership only)</p> <p>All competing aircraft must meet the following requirements:</p> <p>* Video Transmitter output power of 25 mW<br/>* Must be allowed inspection (briefly) before flight by an event organizer<br/>* LED's are not required but are highly encouraged.<br/>* RHCP and LHCP antenna options (equip as assigned) - Seriously though, these are required. Please make the investment ahead of time. Accommodations can be made, but should not be expected.</p> <p>Before the race:<br/>* Set your frequency according to the MultiGP site (This frequency should be the same for the entire main event, but you may be asked to change it to compete in a top-5 race at the end)<br/>* Equip the correct polarity of antenna according to the MultiGP recommendation at the time of your check-in<br/>* Update your MultiGP profile to include your phone number. Text message updates will be sent during the race letting you know you're up!<br/>* Charge your batteries and double check all of your connections.<br/>* Double and triple check that your video works on the exact frequency you've been assigned and that your video is clear and works at a decent range.<br/>* Dress warm/wear layers. While we will be inside and dry, it is an unheated building. Hands will get cold!<br/>* Pack snacks/drinks. All of the ""ripping"" of proverbial ""balls"" may get tiring. You'll need to recharge.<br/>* Optional: Lower your rates. This is an indoor course, so the freestyle rates may be too high. We probably won't be doing much flipping, rolling, or crazy freestyle.</p> <p>Race format:</p> <p>* Race format can change at the last minute, but for the most part we try to stick to this simple format:</p> <p>** Pilots fly 2+ heats of practice</p> <p>** Pilots fly in 5 heats of racing"".</p> <p>** Pilots are ranked based on the best 4 combined results out of the 5 heats (lowest score is dropped).</p> <p>*NOTE: If time allows, and people cooperate, we will go to best 5 of 6 heats. More flying, more fun, more chance for amazing comebacks!</p> <p>Event amenities:<br/>* Restrooms are available in the main lobby to the left of the entrance shown on the map. You will find them through the front doors or through the doors from the stables. * A TV will be displaying real-time scoring and statistics of the race during the event.<br/>* Charging station: Power strips will be provided trackside. You may bring your charger to top off batteries or charge between heats.<br/>* Cleaning station: an air compressor is provided to blow the dirt out of your equipment.</p> <p>* SAFETY: A large safety net protects the spectator and pilot areas. Feel free to bring children! (Just remember to stand behind the netting, these things can be dangerous)</p> <p>See you there!!</p> <p>* 11:15 AM - Course setup and pilot readiness<br/>* 11:30 AM - Aircraft/Safety Inspection/New Pilot Orientation. (Pilots should be ready to fly at this time)<br/>* 11:45 AM - Quick Pilot Meeting and Course Walkthrough<br/>* 12:00 PM - Practice Starts<br/>* 1:00 PM - Quick break, sponsor announcement, raffle (if applicable)<br/>* 1:15 PM - &lt;Racing Resumes&gt;<br/>* Spectators - Come whenever! Flying starts at 12:00 PM so feel free to filter in and out as you please.</p>",14.607203483581545,16200000.0,https://www.meetup.com/NorthwestFPV/events/245534902/,,,,,,,1447457944000,45.459999084472656,-122.6999969482422,19119294,approval,Northwest FPV,NorthwestFPV,Pilots,0,,245534902,0,Christmahanuquadzikkah 2017 - Indoor Drone Race,,,upcoming,1512934200000,1512067803000,-28800000,28250 SW Pete's Mountain Road,,,West Linn,us,24208376.0,45.31645200000001,USA,-122.675598,Oregon Equestrian Center,,False,OR,,public,0,,8,2017-12-10 13:30:00,0,tech

1512293783000,"<p>This discussion will be facilitated by Emily L.</p> <p>For Thursdays discussion we will be discussing the rise of scientific processes and the dialogue among philosophers and scientists around the time of 1700-1750. Bacon and Galileo were early thinkers who utilized and coined the ‘scientific method’ around 1600. Their work, along with Descartes and others, were influential in producing a wave of scientific advancement including Newtons theory of Gravity in the 1670’s. This mode of thought was later adopted by a wave of empiricist thinkers including Locke, Berkely, and Hume in the 17th century. There were some fascinating conversations going on at the time between philosophers and scientists, who were strongly influenced by each other. Alas, the time seems to have passed for such communion between (now) disparate fields of study. Such close engagement with both fields of study resulted in some very interesting philosophic critiques of science. Of particular interest is Hume’s Fork,</p> <p>“Hume's fork is often stated in such a way that statements are divided up into two types:<br/>• Statements about ideas. These are analytic, necessary statements that are knowable a priori.<br/>• Statements about the world. These are synthetic, contingent, and knowable a posteriori.</p> <p>Hume wants to prove that certainty does not exist in science. First, Hume notes that statements of the second type can never be entirely certain, due to the fallibility of our senses, the possibility of deception (see e.g. the modern brain in a vat theory) and other arguments made by philosophical skeptics. It is always logically possible that any given statement about the world is false.”</p> <p>You can read more about this here,<br/><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hume%27s_fork"" class=""linkified"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hume%27s_fork</a></p> <p>More generally, we will also be discussing the benefits and downsides of a rigorous scientific methodology as applied to human behavior, thinking, and formulating conceptions of reality.

This meetup is our most popular one because it's more social than structured. It is our monthly general get together and is the best meeting to get to know us.</p> <p>We start with about an hour or so of sharing/show and tell (not required), and finish with lively chatting about crafts.</p> <p>Bring your work and share it with us. Bring your  design challenges if you want us to brainstorm with you. Or, just bring yourself and share in the craft talk. If you have a project to work on, feel free to bring that along.</p> <p>Following chat time, we have a potluck lunch and then usually a craft camp session (free) or a organized workshop (fee) for a hands on learning experience.</p> <p><br/>The group provides coffee, tea, and water. Some of you occasionally gift us with treats. We always appreciate that. You are always welcome to participate in the potluck lunch.</p> <p><br/>There is no charge for this monthly meetup if this is your first time attending (and you want to check us out), or if you are a member in good standing whose dues are paid. We pay dues yearly at $50 or every 6 months at $30. If you are new to the group, see Linda and she will prorate your dues.</p> <p>Dues help pay the expenses of running our busy and diverse meetup. They also entitle you to participate in workshops that cost a fraction of what you would pay elsewhere.

The complex will have colorful flags near the entrance of the parking lot that the GPS directs you to. Assuming that this is the front of the complex, it's easiest to pass the GPS destination on the access road of the Loop 410 Freeway. After the complex and before Fiesta Inn and Suites is a street called John William Rd. Take a right on John William Rd coming from the Loop 410 Freeway access road. As you are on John William Rd, you will be on the side of the complex which is now at your right and Fiesta Inn and Suites is now on your left. While you are on John William Rd, go toward the second light pole on your right. Take a right into the parking lot next to that light pole which is located at the back of the complex near a wooden fence that separates the complex from the neighborhood. If you enter the neighborhood, you've passed the parking lot that is needed. As soon as you turn into the back parking lot, you will see a silver, Honda Accord on the left parked near the wooden fence and a shed-like structure. If you pass the shed-like structure, you went too far. After you park, follow the pathway between building 43 and building 44. Building 40 is directly across from building 43 and on the left side of building 44. Apartment #4005 is on the first floor of the side of building 40 that you will be facing. If you go to the side that has a playground, you are on the wrong side. If my sign is up that says please do not disturb, I am still in session with a client.

1509663502000,"<p>This meetup is an opportunity for game enthusiasts to come together and play some of our favorite board and card games. </p> <p>There will be a number of games available for play, as well as friendly folks who can help with the rules. We play a wide variety of board and card games; shorter, longer, casual, strategic, cooperative, and competitive. </p> <p>Many of the games we enjoy are European games like Power Grid, Carcassonne, Agricola, and Ticket to Ride. If you are not familiar with these games, they tend to run from 30 to 90 minutes and are different from most of the boardgames we all grew up with. Players are generally not eliminated from the game, so everybody is engaged for the entire game. They also usually involve the accumulation of victory points, so you generally are not having to take directly from other players to advance yourself. The games are also very sociable and a lot of fun. </p> <p><br/>We also play more thematic games like Last Night on Earth, Battlestar Galactica, and King of Tokyo. These games usually have more direct conflict and player elimination which tends to generate a lot of excitement around the table. These games can be short and sweet and finish in less than 30 minutes, or they can be epic slug-fests that deliver hours of entertainment.</p> <p>All ages are welcome but children under 16 must be accompanied by an adult.</p> <p>We are a very informal group that really gets into the games we play, so don't be afraid to introduce yourself and tell us what you'd like to play!</p>",4.532046318054199,,https://www.meetup.com/boardgames-368/events/245164420/,,,,,,,1163530660000,33.990001678466804,-84.16000366210938,365560,open,The Gwinnett Boardgame Society,boardgames-368,Game Players,0,On the corner of Spout Springs Rd. and Thompson Mill Rd. in the Kroger shopping center,fllsxnywqbsb,0,Thursday Night Gaming at Meeple Madness,,,upcoming,1513288800000,1509663502000,-18000000,7400-205 Spout Springs Rd.,,,Braselton,us,23654556.0,34.09798,USA,-83.86705,Meeple Madness,,False,GA,,public,0,,3,2017-12-14 16:00:00,4,games

Join the CAS-GJ Book Club to discuss<i> <b><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Victorio-Warrior-Oklahoma-Western-Biographies/dp/0806157607/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1508518450&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=victorio"">Victorio: Apache Warrior and Chief</a> </b></i>by <b>Kathleen P. Chamberlain</b>. It will be a great chance to read about archaeology and discuss what we learned from the book. Below is a short review of the book. We might even be able to have Bob join us for the discussion.</p> <p><br/><b>A steadfast champion of his people during the wars with encroaching Anglo-Americans, the Apache chief Victorio deserves as much attention as his better-known contemporaries Cochise and Geronimo. In presenting the story of this nineteenth-century Warm Springs Apache warrior, Kathleen P. Chamberlain expands our understanding of Victorio’s role in the Apache wars and brings him into the center of events.</b></p> <p><b>Although there is little documentation of Victorio’s life outside military records, Chamberlain draws on ethnographic sources to surmise his childhood and adolescence and to depict traditional Warm Springs Apache social, religious, and economic life. Reconstructing Victorio’s life beyond the military conflicts that have since come to define him, she interprets his character and actions not only as whites viewed them but also as the logical outcome of his upbringing and worldview.</b></p> <p><b>Chamberlain’s Victorio is a pragmatic leader and a profoundly spiritual man. Caught in the absurdities of post–Civil War Indian policy, Victorio struggled with the glaring disconnect between the U.S. government’s vision for Indians and their own physical, psychological, and spiritual needs.</b></p> <p><b>Graced with historic photos of Victorio, other Apaches, and U.S. military leaders, this biography portrays Victorio as a leader who sought a peaceful homeland for his people in the face of wrongheaded decisions from Washington. It is the most nearly complete and balanced picture yet to emerge of a Native leader caught in the conflicts and compromises of the nineteenth-century Southwest.</b></p> <p>The owner of Out West Books has ordered copies of this title and it is also available through Mesa County Libraries. This will be a great chance to read about archaeology, discuss what we read, and get to know each other better; then, in field trips at various times during the year we will be very likely see some of what we've read about in the book. If you're thinking to yourself, ""I'd like to attend but I'm not sure if I can read the entire book by the time we meet?"" Don't worry, everyone is welcome regardless of how much you have read.</p> <p> At the meeting we will also discuss future books for the reading list. You need not be a paid member of CAS-GJ to attend the Book Club. It is chapter policy to participate in field trips you do need to be a paid member. If you want to go see some of what is written about in the book and gazillions of other rock art and ruins areas and other CAS-GJ field trip destinations, please click this link for the membership application. </p> <p>**** Please be aware that by using the bookstore we probably each need to buy something in the store; even if it just a window decal.****</p>",19.22977638244629,5400000.0,https://www.meetup.com/CAS-GJ/events/244379992/,,,,,,,1430352983000,39.08000183105469,-108.54000091552734,18569837,open,Colorado Archaeological Society- Grand Junction Chapter,CAS-GJ,Archaeophiles,0,You will see our crowd in the store.,244379992,0,CAS-GJ Book Club -  Victorio by Kathleen P.

The 57-year-old U.S. embargo against Cuba is an anachronistic relic from the Cold War. Today 2 out of every 3 Americans believe the embargo and travel ban should be abolished. In 2014 Pres. Obama called the embargo a failed and counterproductive policy, loosened travel and trade restrictions, and asked Congress to put an end to this absurd policy. Congress failed to act, and now Donald Trump has rolled back Obama’s relaxation of these restrictions.<br/>Having traveled to Cuba many times over the past 30 years, Ike Nahem is a knowledgeable analyst of U.S. – Cuba relations. On Friday (Dec. 8) he will travel to Albany to discuss the implications of the latest efforts to deny Americans our right to travel to this Caribbean island of unique natural beauty and rich culture only 90 miles away. Visiting Cuba may enable Americans to appreciate the difference that reorienting societal priorities toward more humane and equitable goals can make.

In its two and a half centuries of service, there was hardly an epidemic or social catastrophe—or groundbreaking scientific advance—that did not touch Bellevue.<br/>  David Oshinsky, whose last book, <i>Polio: An American Story</i>, was awarded a Pulitzer Prize, chronicles the history of America's oldest hospital and in so doing also charts the rise of New York to the nation's preeminent city, the path of American medicine from butchery and quackery to a professional and scientific endeavor, and the growth of a civic institution. From its origins in 1738 as an almshouse and pesthouse, Bellevue today is a revered public hospital bringing first-class care to anyone in need. With its diverse, ailing, and unprotesting patient population, the hospital was a natural laboratory for the nation's first clinical research. It treated tens of thousands of Civil War soldiers, launched the first civilian ambulance corps and the first nursing school for women, pioneered medical photography and psychiatric treatment, and spurred New York City to establish the country's first official Board of Health.<br/>  As medical technology advanced, ""voluntary"" hospitals began to seek out patients willing to pay for their care. For charity cases, it was left to Bellevue to fill the void. The latter decades of the twentieth century brought rampant crime, drug addiction, and homelessness to the nation's struggling cities—problems that called a public hospital's very survival into question. It took the AIDS crisis to cement Bellevue's enduring place as New York's ultimate safety net, the iconic hospital of last resort. Lively, page-turning, fascinating, <i>Bellevue</i> is essential American history.</p> <p>Editorial Reviews</p> <p>Review</p> <p>“Any exciting book about the history of Bellevue—which this one surely is—is destined to be as much about the history of disease, medicine and New York City as about the hospital itself. Mr. Oshinsky’s chapters about the early days of medicine are especially, distractingly interesting—so much so that they’ll inspire you to read them aloud to anyone who’ll listen . . . Mr. Oshinsky, who won the 2006 Pulitzer Prize for history for <i>Polio: An American Story</i>, has a lovely flair for detail.”<br/><b>—Jennifer Senior, <i>The New York Times</i></b></p> <p>“Brilliant and deliciously readable . . . The story of Bellevue, Oshinsky convincingly demonstrates, is the story of modern medicine, of New York City, and of America itself.”<br/><b><i>—Boston Globe</i></b></p> <p>“Deeply engrossing . . . Oshinsky has wrestled an institutional history of significant complexity into a compelling tale . . . [He] is a master of finding and relating memorable anecdotes to embody the history. The result is a serious story studded with juicy and occasionally blood-curdling bits from the past.”<br/><b><i>—Chicago Tribune</i></b></p> <p>“No other hospital is as embedded in our culture as Bellevue. David Oshinsky’s biography of this grand dame of America’s public hospitals is a page-turner . . . Oshinsky has captured the spirit, the resilience that is Bellevue, a quality that rubs off on the legions who have trained there. A wonderful read!”<br/><b>—Abraham Verghese, author of <i>Cutting for Stone</i></b></p> <p>“Compelling . . . In this rich history, we bear witness to a remarkable transformation as Bellevue evolves from bare-bones almshouse appendage in the 1700s to world-class academic medical center today . . . Oshinsky simply has a wealth of great material, and it’s a joy to traverse it with him.”<br/><b><i>—USA Today</i></b></p> <p>“You’ll walk away in awe of this tenacious institution—and marvel at the way Oshinsky also fits a comprehensive but succinct history of modern medicine itself into the same book.”<br/><b><i>—Entertainment Weekly</i></b></p> <p>About the Author</p> <p>DAVID OSHINSKY, Ph.D., is a professor in the NYU Department of History and director of the Division of Medical Humanities at the NYU School of Medicine. In 2005, he won the Pulitzer Prize in History for <i>Polio: An American Story</i>. His other books include the D.B. Hardeman Prize-winning <i>A Conspiracy So Immense: The World of Joe McCarthy</i>, and the Robert Kennedy Prize-winning <i>""Worse Than Slavery"": Parchman Farm and the Ordeal of Jim Crow Justice</i>.

PLEASE KNOW YOUR LIMITATIONS!!! This hike is short, but a tough one.***</p> <p>There will be several brief breaks at overlooks of the Richmond Skyline, Church Hill, and/or Shockoe Bottom. Bring a headlamp, flashlight, or use your mobile phone flashlight app. You will take over 10,000 steps (not stairs) which is well over the daily recommended amount in two hours. There are several sets of stairs to tackle which equals 1,149 stair steps. It is the most intense hiking area around I know of in the Richmond area. The terrain is mostly paved and brick sidewalks. Some sidewalks are uneven. There is also a dirt decline which has the usual stumps and small rocks. I will give brief breaks to take in the beautiful views of our city.</p> <p>PARKING: Park for free on the street.

Hiking is the perfect way to get out and enjoy the natural beauty of the Tampa Bay area. Come on out and join us. The park is located on the eastern shore of Lake Tarpon, which is the largest lake in Pinellas County (5 miles long and over a mile wide). There are three nature trails. The elevated boardwalk runs along the boat ramp, leading to an elevated lookout tower for a scenic overview of Lake Tarpon. The North Trail begins at Shelter #10, running through a cypress swamp to the canoe trail—it does not loop back.

1497030150000,"<p>We will be playing No Limit Holdem every night in the league this year. </p> <p>Barry Galen and Len Brocki will be again be hosting a Texas Hold’em League at the Christopher Club in Kettering. The league will play every other week on Fridays thru the end of April 2018 (except the last Friday in December 2017). There will be 20 tournaments overall. The buy-in each week will be $50 of which $40 goes to the tournament prize fund. The additional $10 will be used to fund a Tournament of Champions (TOC) where the top 30 point leaders over the 10 month period will qualify to play for whatever is in the TOC fund. See the details below.</p> <p><br/>Our main goal associated with our tournaments and cash games is that we want to provide a legal, safe, honest, fair and fun place for poker players to enjoy our “sport”. There will never be a rake to benefit the house or any one player and everyone will show respect for others and the way they decide to play their cards. Anyone caught cheating or showing disrespect for others will be banned from the league. Having said that, here are the key points regarding the tournaments for all to consider:</p> <p><b>Friday Night Tournaments</b></p> <p>• The tournaments will be every other Friday and will start promptly at 7 pm.</p> <p>•  The buy in is $50 with $40 going to the payout each Friday. If we average close to 30 players a night the payout will be $1,200 and we will pay 1 spot for every 5 players. Final table chops are OK, provided that all remaining players agree with the terms.</p> <p>• The tournaments will all be No Limit Texas Hold’em.</p> <p>• We will use Roberts rules at all times to settle disagreements or issues. The house (Barry or Len) reserves the right to make the final decision on all disputes. We do not like house rules so we will do our best to run our games like a Casino.</p> <p>•  The starting chips will be 12,000 and we will accept new players until the end of the first break. We use <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/"">www.meetup.com</a> to advertise our meeting so please use the site to RSVP your attendance.</p> <p>• Blind levels will be 20 minutes for all levels.</p> <p>• We will not be using antes in any of the tournaments.</p> <p><b>Tournament of Champions (TOC)</b></p> <p>• There will be a TOC at the end of the 10 month period funded by the extra $10 each week. Each week we will be donating $75 to the Christopher Club out of the TOC fund to cover the rent and cleaning of the room we will be playing in. It is a nice a safe place to play.</p> <p>• The top 30 point leaders will play in a free roll at the end of the 10 months for the pot. We will use the best 15 out of the 20 scores over the league to calculate the point total for the TOC. This should encourage those that cannot play every week to still play.</p> <p>• Each week, a WSOP player of the year point chart will be used. Minimum points will be 10 with points going up like a bell curve the closer you get to the final table. A link to the file with the points will be posted to the meetup web site for all to see.</p> <p>• The first place point leader at the end of the 10 months will get $200 off the top of the TOC prize pool.</p> <p>• Starting chip stack will 20,000 for 30th place and graduate up at 500 chips per place so that the point leader will have 34,500 chips for an average chip stack of 27,250.</p> <p>• The TOC date will be announced close to the end of each TOC.</p> <p><b>Cash Games</b></p> <p>• We will have a cash game after the tournaments as a table is freed up.</p> <p>• The games played are usually dealer’s choice.</p> <p>• There is no rake taken at any cash game.</p> <p>Please call Barry or Len at the numbers below if you have any questions or need to adjust your RSVP at the last minute.</p> <p>Barry Galen (937)[masked]&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p>Len Brocki (513)[masked]&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p>",17.929258346557614,,https://www.meetup.com/kettering-poker/events/240669390/,,,,,,,1161979281000,39.66999816894531,-84.12000274658203,353712,approval,"Doug, Len and Pat's Poker Meetup Group",kettering-poker,Poker Players,0,Go to Governor's Place off Dorothy Ln and enter driveway at the end we are in the building in the back right corner of the parking lot,240669390,0,Friday Night Texas Hold'em League 2017/2018 (19 of 20),,60.0,upcoming,1523660400000,1500752121000,-14400000,3150 S Dixie Hwy,,,Kettering,US,20852352.0,39.705017,USA,-84.201309,The Christopher Club,,False,,,public,0,,14,2018-04-13 18:00:00,5,games

We'll also talk about some of the common failure modes in each, and what to be aware of to help avoid them.

My partners have. They are pursuing off-market deals in major markets and building their portfolios. The key to their success is finding the right partners. They gain confidence, capital, knowledge, financial strength and get rid of fear.</p> <p>I started my journey as a 23 year old and have partners. Now almost 10 years later, I've built a portfolio valued at $7.5mm. My partner has a portfolio of almost 1,400 units (thanks to partners), Ryan from Cushman &amp; Wakefield has access to off-market deals and Robert has access to high net-worth and institutional real estate investors. </p> <p>Just like my group of partners, you can also overcome challenges of lack of capital, weak financial strength, lack of knowledge, gain access to off-market deals, remove fear of failure and inability to take that next step. </p> <p>So far we are doing a great job. Many partners are working on a 10-70 unit deals. Our relationships were leveraged to find off-market deals and help with fund raising (equity and debt).

Bill is essentially a self-taught photographer, although many have contributed inspiration, advice and direction to his work. He has studied Ansel Adams’ works on the effects of lighting in photography. Bill and Cheryl express their view that photographs are captured moments in time that help us remember, enjoy and cherish the world around us.</p> <p>After retiring from his full-time career, Bill wanted to try selling photographs that people would buy as art. Cheryl attended a craft fair and thought exhibiting there would be a great way to bring his work to the public’s attention. Bill took time to learn what makes the difference between a photograph and a work of art. Inspired by photographers David Kiley and Rodney Lough, he learned various digital and color techniques.</p> <p>Cheryl is a strong source of inspiration and encouragement for him, and also contributes her own photographs to their gallery of images. Her photography features portraits and moments of celebration and ceremony that add intimacy and richness to Bill’s work.</p> <p>Bill and Cheryl’s captured moments of beauty and joy are shared in their photography.</p> <p><a href=""http://photographybybillschafer.com"">photographybybillschafer.com</a></p> <p><br/><img src=""https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/0/5/a/600_466421050.jpeg"" /></p> <p>Photo by Bill Schafer</p> <p><br/>__________________________________________________________________________</p> <p><br/><b>About the Silver Spring Camera Club</b></p> <p><br/>We have activities the first three Thursdays of every month, September – May, and one day on a weekend for a field trip to an interesting photogenic location in the area.</p> <p><br/>More information about the Silver Spring Camera Club can be found on our <a href=""http://www.ssccphotography.org/"">website</a> regarding speakers, competition, education, open forum topics and even where we're going to meet on our field trip.</p> <p>Don’t forget to read our PSA award winning newsletter the <a href=""http://www.ssccphotography.org/"">Cable Release</a> for even more detailed information about all our activities and other items of photographic interest.</p> <p>We hope to see you at a meeting soon.</p> <p><b>Visitors to the Club are always welcome to attend meetings</b>.</p> <p>Membership remains a very reasonable $45 for individual members, $65 for family and only $35 for students.</p> <p>A membership application can be found on our <a href=""http://www.ssccphotography.org/"">website.<br/></a></p> <p><img src=""http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/2/6/a/600_441525674.jpeg"" /></p>",9.973870277404783,,https://www.meetup.com/Silver-Spring-Camera-Club/events/245394771/,,,,,,,1437343731000,39.02000045776367,-77.01000213623047,18752773,open,Silver Spring Camera Club,Silver-Spring-Camera-Club,Photographers,0,We meet in the Brotherhood Hall below the main sanctuary,245394771,0,"Social Hour & Speaker Night: Bill Schafer, ""Photography as Art""",,101.0,upcoming,1512689400000,1511650018000,-18000000,8900 Georgia Ave,,,Silver Spring,US,24027114.0,39.000908,USA,-77.033714,Silver Spring United Methodist Church,,False,,,public,0,,19,2017-12-07 17:30:00,4,photography

There are numerous steps in between, many of which are unknown to people entering into the space. We'll talk about the common workflows for turning ideas into models, evaluating models, constructing risk constrained portfolios, and executing profitable trades. We'll also talk about some of the common failure modes in each, and what to be aware of to help avoid them. Among the free and open source tools we'll discuss are alphalens, the Quantopian risk model, and pyfolio.</p> <p>Register <a href=""https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/4783166239008002818""><b>here</b></a>!</p> <p><b>About the Speaker</b></p> <p>Delaney’s background is in computer science, statistics, math, and computational genetics. As Director of Academia at Quantopian, he oversees the firm’s worldwide educational and academic initiatives. While working with professors at schools including Princeton, MIT, Stanford, and Harvard, Delaney developed the free online Quantopian Lecture Series. The lecture series draws from academic rigor and industry realism and has since spawned a global workshop program teaching quantitative finance.

1497029907000,"<p>We will be playing No Limit Holdem every night in the league this year. </p> <p>Barry Galen and Len Brocki will be again be hosting a Texas Hold’em League at the Christopher Club in Kettering. The league will play every other week on Fridays thru the end of April 2018 (except the last Friday in December 2017). There will be 20 tournaments overall. The buy-in each week will be $50 of which $40 goes to the tournament prize fund. The additional $10 will be used to fund a Tournament of Champions (TOC) where the top 30 point leaders over the 10 month period will qualify to play for whatever is in the TOC fund. See the details below.</p> <p><br/>Our main goal associated with our tournaments and cash games is that we want to provide a legal, safe, honest, fair and fun place for poker players to enjoy our “sport”. There will never be a rake to benefit the house or any one player and everyone will show respect for others and the way they decide to play their cards. Anyone caught cheating or showing disrespect for others will be banned from the league. Having said that, here are the key points regarding the tournaments for all to consider:</p> <p><b>Friday Night Tournaments</b></p> <p>• The tournaments will be every other Friday and will start promptly at 7 pm.</p> <p>•  The buy in is $50 with $40 going to the payout each Friday. If we average close to 30 players a night the payout will be $1,200 and we will pay 1 spot for every 5 players. Final table chops are OK, provided that all remaining players agree with the terms.</p> <p>• The tournaments will all be No Limit Texas Hold’em.</p> <p>• We will use Roberts rules at all times to settle disagreements or issues. The house (Barry or Len) reserves the right to make the final decision on all disputes. We do not like house rules so we will do our best to run our games like a Casino.</p> <p>•  The starting chips will be 12,000 and we will accept new players until the end of the first break. We use <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/"">www.meetup.com</a> to advertise our meeting so please use the site to RSVP your attendance.</p> <p>• Blind levels will be 20 minutes for all levels.</p> <p>• We will not be using antes in any of the tournaments.</p> <p><b>Tournament of Champions (TOC)</b></p> <p>• There will be a TOC at the end of the 10 month period funded by the extra $10 each week. Each week we will be donating $75 to the Christopher Club out of the TOC fund to cover the rent and cleaning of the room we will be playing in. It is a nice a safe place to play.</p> <p>• The top 30 point leaders will play in a free roll at the end of the 10 months for the pot. We will use the best 15 out of the 20 scores over the league to calculate the point total for the TOC. This should encourage those that cannot play every week to still play.</p> <p>• Each week, a WSOP player of the year point chart will be used. Minimum points will be 10 with points going up like a bell curve the closer you get to the final table. A link to the file with the points will be posted to the meetup web site for all to see.</p> <p>• The first place point leader at the end of the 10 months will get $200 off the top of the TOC prize pool.</p> <p>• Starting chip stack will 20,000 for 30th place and graduate up at 500 chips per place so that the point leader will have 34,500 chips for an average chip stack of 27,250.</p> <p>• The TOC date will be announced close to the end of each TOC.</p> <p><b>Cash Games</b></p> <p>• We will have a cash game after the tournaments as a table is freed up.</p> <p>• The games played are usually dealer’s choice.</p> <p>• There is no rake taken at any cash game.</p> <p>Please call Barry or Len at the numbers below if you have any questions or need to adjust your RSVP at the last minute.</p> <p>Barry Galen (937)[masked]&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p>Len Brocki (513)[masked]&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p>",7.4469170570373535,,https://www.meetup.com/kettering-poker/events/240669266/,,,,,,,1161979281000,39.66999816894531,-84.12000274658203,353712,approval,"Doug, Len and Pat's Poker Meetup Group",kettering-poker,Poker Players,0,Go to Governor's Place off Dorothy Ln and enter driveway at the end we are in the building in the back right corner of the parking lot,240669266,0,Friday Night Texas Hold'em League 2017/2018 (13 of 20),,60.0,upcoming,1516406400000,1500751836000,-18000000,3150 S Dixie Hwy,,,Kettering,US,20852352.0,39.705017,USA,-84.201309,The Christopher Club,,False,,,public,0,,15,2018-01-19 18:00:00,5,games

I'm not allowed to publish it, or else I would.</p> <p>$5 donation is requested per meeting, or $20/month if you want to do it that way.</p> <p>A Note About the Group:</p> <p>Over the course of this group's existence, we've had a lot of fun times. We've taken Stephen Colbert's words to heart. ""Everybody else is"" the most important person in the scene. For us, this means that respect for one another is essential to our group's success. It's the glue that keeps us together, and it's why this group has stayed so strong. Humor does not require of us that we make our fellow players uncomfortable by reducing their role to a stereotype (we don't need to gift the women with sexual roles, for instance).

Something evil is trapping the souls of the dead and draining life from all who have been raised from death by magic. This worldwide “death curse” not only prevents the raising of the dead but also causes creatures that were previously raised from the dead to wither and die. The source of this death curse lies in a trap-riddled tomb hidden beneath a lost city in the depths of a vast jungle. </p> <p>


Tomb of Annihilation is a Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure that takes place on the peninsula of Chult in the Forgotten Realms. Chult is a tropical wilderness composed mostly of jungles, plateaus, impassable mountains, and belching volcanoes. You can substitute a different jungle setting, changing location names as needed. Alternative D&amp;D settings include the Amedio Jungle of Oerth, the Savage Coast of Mystara, the jungles of Xen’drik on Eberron, or a comparable setting on your home campaign world.</p>",10.680941581726074,12600000.0,https://www.meetup.com/Role-Playing-Games-Charlotte-NC/events/245658883/,,,,,,,1462580780000,35.31999969482422,-80.73999786376953,19924140,open,"Role-Playing Games - Charlotte, NC",Role-Playing-Games-Charlotte-NC,Dice Hoarders,0,,245658883,0,Tomb of Annihilation - session seven,,8.0,upcoming,1513034100000,1512451071000,-18000000,"1224 Commercial Ave, Charlotte, North Carolina 28205",,,Charlotte,us,24645113.0,35.245827,USA,-80.782684,Get Some Game,,False,NC,,public,0,,4,2017-12-11 17:15:00,1,games

Because this is my birthday, I was incarnated into this body on this day. This is the day I saw for the first time the green of the trees and the blue of the skies. This was the day I for the first time opened my eyes and saw God all around. Of course the word 'God' didn't exist at that moment, but what I saw was God. I was thinking what should I give to you today? Then I remembered a saying of Buddha: SABBA DANAM DHAMMA DANANA JNATI -- the gift of truth excels all other gifts. And my truth is love.</p> <p>The word 'truth' looks to me a little too dry and desert-like. I am not in much tune with the word 'truth' -- it looks too logical, it looks too 'heady'. It gives you the feeling of philosophy, not of religion. It gives you the idea as if you have concluded -- that you have come to a conclusion, that there has been a syllogism behind it, argumentation and logic and reasoning. No, 'truth' is not my word, 'love' is my word. Love is of the heart. Truth is partial, only your head is involved. In love you are involved as a totality -- your body, your mind, your soul, all are involved.</p> <p>Love makes you a unity -- and not a union, remember, but a unity. Because in a union those who join together remain separate. In a unity they dissolve, they become one, they melt into each other. And that moment I call the moment of truth, when love has given you unity. First, love gives you unity in your innermost core. Then you are no more a body, no more a mind, no more a soul. You are simply one -- unnamed, undefined, unclassified. No more determinate, definable, no more comprehensible. A mystery, a joy, a surprise, a jubilation, a great celebration.""</p> <p>--Osho<br/>From 'This Very Body the Buddha'</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Yoga Mat, Meditation Chair, Your Being</p> <p>• Important to know</p> <p>1. If meditation is an “inward phenomenon” then why can’t I just meditate at home?</p> <p>Group energy helps meditator. Occasional group meditation can boost your individual daily meditations.</p> <p>2. This is my first time, what should I expect?</p> <p>Osho meditations are non-serious. Come with an open mind and participate totally; ""Totally"" is the key. 3. What should I wear?<br/>Wear lose clothing, as lose clothing will not hinder the flow of energy in your body.</p>",10.037452697753906,14400000.0,https://www.meetup.com/oshomeditationatlanta/events/245672268/,,,,,,,1251125354000,33.81999969482422,-84.36000061035156,1511788,open,Osho Meditation Atlanta,oshomeditationatlanta,Meditators,0,Meditation Hall enterance is at the back of the house,245672268,0,Osho Birthday Celebration and Holiday Party,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/9/9/6/global_466679798.jpeg,35.0,upcoming,1513526400000,1512501678000,-18000000,1750 Thunder Gulch Pass,,,Suwanee,us,25648908.0,34.106644,USA,-84.11859,Osho Vivek Meditation Center,,False,ga,30024,public,0,,18,2017-12-17 10:00:00,0,new age/spirituality

But what if our bodies are tense and we do not know why? What if we have stored trauma within our cells that we do not know how to get to? When we are small children, we are so open. We feel everything. When we are hurt in the slightest way, we store those memories inside our bodies as cellular memory. It gets stuck there. Our pain gets stored inside our bodies as cellular memories that, unless dealt with, will remain there for the rest of our lives. This is why we are hindered. This is why some of us struggle in our lives. Low vibrational energy that remains stuck inside our cells.</p> <p>The Gene Keys offers us a clear and concise way to release stored energy within our bodies that no longer serve us but kept us safe in childhood. The Gene Keys are a kind, gentle approach to working with the specific energy in our bodies the help us find freedom. To find joy. To discover peace. We are able to breathe deeper. Know ourselves more fully. Be in a state of calm and delight at all times. Because we know ourselves. We know who we are and why we are here. The answers lie inside us and all it takes is a bit of contemplation to release the blocked energy within our forms.</p> <p>If you are having trouble walking through life in grace and ease you may benefit from working with your gene keys. We are a safe group of people working on ourselves to release our Divine Gifts.</p> <p>****************************************************************************************</p> <p>A few notes and Important Information:</p> <p>If you wish to explore more information on the Gene Keys Visit:</p> <p><a href=""http://teachings.genekeys.com/about/new/ref/191/""><a href=""http://teachings.genekeys.com/about/new/ref/191/"" class=""linkified"">http://teachings.genekeys.com/about/new/ref/191/</a></a></p> <p>The following link will allow you to created an active and free flowing Halogenetic Profile.

Personally, I think it’s a spectrum which includes everything from good intentions communicated poorly all the way to things like exploitation and intimidation. Often, things that amount to less than “harassment” still warrant scrutiny. I think we should open ourselves up to discussing this spectrum from all sides. Both genders should attend feeling compelled to honesty about this topic, which means that no perspective should go punished here. Please just be respectful in dialogue and open to hearing new perspectives, as always.

One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. </p> <p><i>When Breath Becomes Air </i>chronicles Kalanithi’s transformation from a naïve medical student “possessed,” as he wrote, “by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life” into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality.</p> <p>What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir.</p> <p>Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. “I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything,” he wrote. “Seven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: ‘I can’t go on. I’ll go on.’” </p> <p><i>When Breath Becomes Air </i>is an unforgettable, life-affirming reflection on the challenge of facing death and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a brilliant writer who became both.</p>",17.102569580078125,7200000.0,https://www.meetup.com/Lake-Norman-Smart-Womens-Book-Club-Meetup/events/244127246/,,,,,,,1449014678000,35.47999954223633,-80.86000061035156,19173357,approval,Lake Norman Smart Women's Book Club Meet Up,Lake-Norman-Smart-Womens-Book-Club-Meetup,LKN Book Groupies,0,,244127246,0,"Read ""When Breath Becomes Air"" by Paul Kalanith",,15.0,upcoming,1515454200000,1507763306000,-18000000,"9705 Sam Furr Road, Suite A",,,Huntersville,us,23585937.0,35.442219,USA,-80.863625,Waterbean Coffee,,False,NC,,public,7,,15,2018-01-08 17:30:00,1,book clubs

Just a few years earlier, Jews living in Portugal were dragged to the baptismal font and forced to convert to Christianity. Many of these New Christians persevered in their Jewish prayers and rituals in secret and at great risk; the hidden, arcane practices of the kabbalists, a mystical sect of Jews, continued as well.</p> <p>One such secret Jew was Berekiah Zarco, an intelligent young manuscript illuminator. Inflamed by love and revenge, he searches, in the crucible of the raging pogrom, for the killer of his beloved uncle Abraham, a renowned kabbalist and manuscript illuminator, discovered murdered in a hidden synagogue along with a young girl in dishabille. Risking his life in streets seething with mayhem, Berekiah tracks down answers among Christians, New Christians, Jews, and the fellow kabbalists of his uncle, whose secret language and codes by turns light and obscure the way to the truth he seeks.

In the hidden high-security government laboratory where she works as a cleaner, mute Elisa (Sally Hawkins, Blue Jasmine, Maudie) is trapped in a life of lonely isolation. Elisa’s life is changed forever when she and co-worker Zelda (Octavia Spencer, Hidden Figures, The Help) discover a secret classified experiment. Visually dazzling and emotionally daring, The Shape of Water merges the pathos and thrills of the classic monster movie tradition with shadowy film noir, stirring in the heat of a love story like no other to explore the fantasies we all flirt with, the mysteries we can’t control and the monstrosities we must confront. Also starring Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins, Doug Jones and Michael Stuhlbarg.</p> <p>Please be on time 3:30 PM to relax and converse with your fellow movie-going friends and to make sure you have enough time to get your voucher from me first to exchange for your ticket at the box office. to relax and converse with your fellow movie-going friends and to make sure you have enough time to get your voucher from me first to exchange for your ticket at the box office.If possible, try to have exact change.To get the best seats we will go into the theater at 3:50 PM or before.</p> <p>Where to Meet:<br/>Meet BELOW the Box Office at the Tables in the Courtyard (Plaza Level).Look for me and/or the MeetUp Sign.Or CALL Me:[masked]<br/>Landmark Hillcrest Cinemas (<a href=""http://maps.google.com/maps?q=3965%205th%20Ave.%2C%20San%20Diego%2C%20CA)3965"" class=""linkified"">http://maps.google.com/maps?q=3965%205th%20Ave.%2C%20San%20Diego%2C%20CA)3965</a> 5th AvenueSan Diego, California 92103</p> <p>Parking:<br/>Free Three Hour Validated Parking in Theater's Underground Parking StructureorFree Street Parking after 8:00 PM</p> <p>Perks:<br/>Local Restaurants</p> <p>Questions?<br/>For the Fastest Response...Please Call Me!<br/>Jeffrey<br/>[masked]</p> <p>Before and/or After the movie, if we have enough members that are interested, we will meet at a local restaurant to have some time to relax and converse.</p> <p>***Please be courteous to your fellow movie-going friends by refraining from talking and texting during the movies.

And they are realizing that LeSS is not “Scrum contained within each team, with something different on top.” It seems some scaling frameworks contain Scrum like a fire fighter contains a brushfire.</p> <p>Then what is LeSS about? It is to see the ineffectiveness of traditional large-scale organizational design and to change it, by descaling with LeSS towards a simple model for multiple teams that optimizes for agility (flexibility), learning, and flow of value. It is figuring out how, with multiple teams, to apply the simple principles and elements of Scrum that encourage empirical process control, transparency, self-managing teams, and systems optimization.</p> <p>But any structural change per definition challenges the status quo of middle-management and single-specialist positions, leading to the dynamics of Larman's Laws of Organizational Behavior.</p> <p>In this meetup Craig will explore descaling with LeSS.</p> <p>


<b>LeSS Summary</b></p> <p><a href=""http://less.works"">LeSS</a> (Large-Scale Scrum) is the simple high-impact framework for scaling lean and agile development designed to optimize the whole system. It’s based on over a decade of adoptions in many big groups worldwide (e.g., see <a href=""http://less.works/case-studies/index.html"">case studies</a>). In addition to learning about it at <a href=""http://less.works/"">less.works</a>, it’s described in the three books on LeSS that come from that decade of experience:</p> <p><br/>• <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Large-Scale-Scrum-More-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0321985710"">Large-Scale Scrum: More with LeSS</a></p> <p>• <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Scaling-Lean-Agile-Development-Organizational/dp/0321480961"">Scaling Lean &amp; Agile Development: Thinking &amp; Organizational Tools for Large-Scale Scrum</a></p> <p>• <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Practices-Scaling-Lean-Agile-Development/dp/0321636406"">Practices for Scaling Lean &amp; Agile Development: Successful Large, Multisite &amp; Offshore Product Development with Large-Scale Scrum</a></p> <p><br/>Although LeSS is described as for scaling, a key purpose of LeSS -- the implication of its name -- is actually descaling through organizational simplification. Descaling the number of roles, organizational structures, dependencies, architectural complexity, management positions, sites, and number of people. LeSS is not about ‘enabling’ an existing big and clumsy organization to “do agile” by painting agile labels on top, it is about scaling up the simple Scrum framework itself to achieve organizational descaling.</p> <p>In a way, LeSS is simple because there’s only a small set of elements, whose purpose is transparency and empirical process control. It’s ‘hard’ because transparency reveals weakness, and empiricism requires learning and change rather than following a recipe.</p> <p>Unlike some other scaling frameworks, LeSS does not define a one-size-fits-all detailed recipe, and like Scrum, is based on recognizing that development is too complex and situational for a prescriptive detailed recipe that a group can just “buy and install.” Rather, it will require creating a learning organization, and lots of situational adaptation.</p> <p>There are no fancy titles, no trains, no layers of management, but when you simplify and descale, you ought to be able to achieve more impact and flexibility with LeSS.</p> <p>

1508782756000,"<p>December Event Code[masked]</p> <p>A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for levels 5-9.</p> <p>For more than 2 millennia, the nation of Rahadoum has lived under the Laws of Man that decreed ""let no man be beholden to a god."" While this has led to relative peace without religious strife, it has left the nation devoid of divine healing and magical methods to provide succor to those ravaged by disease or injury. When a new and mysterious plague begins ravaging the coastal villages of Rahadoum, you are sent by the Pathfinder Society to escort a cleric of Sarenrae into the heart of the plague in order to protect a secret Pathfinder research project. Getting there means smuggling the cleric in as contraband and when the Pure Legion, Rahadoum's defense against religion, get wind of your arrival, you must fight not only to protect the cleric, but to keep yourselves from being executed for violating the First Heresy.</p> <p>The First Heresy is the first scenario in the The Heresy of Man campaign arc. <a href=""http://paizo.com/pathfinder/v5748btpy8g1t"">Pathfinder Society Scenario #2-07: The Heresy of Man—Part II: Where Dark Things Sleep</a> is the sequel.</p> <p>Written by Greg A.

1509888360000,"<p>A very special mercury retrograde: it starts on December 3 (full moon in Gemini) and ends about the same time as the winter solstice. Mercury goes retrograde for the final time in 2017, from December 3-22 and will be guiding all of us to reflect on the year gone by.</p> <p>Whenever Mercury goes retrograde, it is time for our mind to pay a little visit to the past. These visits to the past allow us to reflect on things and to gain new information that perhaps we overlooked before.<br/>-----What are you overlooking as this year winds down?</p> <p>Mercury is the messenger of the Gods and when in retrograde, it allows us to unearth buried truths or thought patterns that may be blocking us from moving forward or getting where we want to go.</p> <p>----What thought patterns are blocking you from moving forward?</p> <p>Mercury rules over our mind, which is one of the most powerful tools we have. Our mind can be so powerful that it can shape our reality and change how we feel. Our mind also governs over our vibration and can help inspire us to take action or to back down.</p> <p>When Mercury slips into retrograde mode, we are given the opportunity to tap into more of our subconscious mind and understand things on a deeper level. We may even receive messages from our Divine team that allows us to know the path forward. Both the Full Moon and the Solstice are going to be helping us to wrap up any loose ends before the close of 2017, and it seems that Mercury Retrograde is also going to be helping with this process too. During this time, the cosmos is really going to be asking us to bring closure to the year gone by and to clear through any mental chatter that we have been walking around with.</p> <p>---what mental chatter are you walking around with that needs to be cleared? Many people view Mercury retrograde as an inconvenience, but really it is a gift. It allows us access to the hidden realms of the mind and helps us to understand ourselves on a whole new level.</p> <p>Mercury retrograde is not the time to start new things or to pursue new ideas. It is also not the ideal time to have important conversations or to communicate an idea to someone else. Instead, it is a time for inner reflection. It is a time to revisit the past and to reflect on where you have been and where you want to go. The theme for December’s retrograde is really about releasing and shedding all the mental blocks and thought patterns from 2017 so you can enter 2018 with a fresh perspective and a new outlook.</p> <p>Whatever messages you need to hear will arise during the retrograde period, however it is likely that you won’t really be able to understand them until Mercury goes direct again on December 22.</p> <p>In order to hear the messages Mercury has for you, spend time clearing your mind of any unnecessary thoughts or mental chatter.</p> <p>By clearing your mind, you will be able to receive messages more clearly and you will be able to observe your mind from a more peaceful place.<br/>----How can I clear my mind? (Hint: read the next sentence)</p> <p>Journalling and reflecting on any thoughts and feelings that come up would also be very valuable at this time.</p> <p>Mercury retrograde can often bring a lot of clarity, so if you are looking for guidance, meditating or journalling is really going to help. Just be patient, and know that you will need to wait until Mercury goes direct to put the final pieces into place.</p> <p>As the final Mercury retrograde of the year, use this cycle to clear out the closets of your mind and work through any mental blocks or thought patterns that are keeping you from getting where you want to be.</p> <p>When you use Mercury retrograde energy in this way, you are going to feel empowered by this time of year and not inconvenienced.</p>",3.8781130313873287,10800000.0,https://www.meetup.com/Newport-Beach-Learning-Tarot-Meetup/events/244849636/,,,,,,,1498782632000,33.639999389648445,-117.86000061035156,24754391,open,Newport Beach Learning Tarot Meetup,Newport-Beach-Learning-Tarot-Meetup,Members,0,Big Canyon East Gate,zjcxxnywqbkb,0,"The ""re"" words:  Mercury Retrograde",https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/6/f/e/global_466698174.jpeg,9.0,upcoming,1512693900000,1512586904000,-28800000,1 Rue Du Parc,,,Newport Beach,US,25335918.0,33.617661,USA,-117.866974,1 Rue Du Parc,,False,,,public,1,,9,2017-12-07 18:45:00,4,new age/spirituality

Alicia Heyburn, of Brunswick, spent five weeks last summer on a solo bicycle tour from the source of the Rhine River in the Swiss Alps, to the outlet at the North Sea near Amsterdam. Traveling on an exceptional network of bike paths, she experienced the various characters of the river along its 1300 km course - wild, tamed, power-producing, awe-inspiring, industrial and bucolic; and met with people who are working to improve river conditions for migratory fish, such as salmon. </p> <p>In her presentation you will learn about Europe's extensive international network of bike trails, free cultural exchange and accommodation services, the stages and benefits of re-naturalizing a river, and how to travel alone without being lonely or turn an interest into an expedition.</p> <p><b>Presentation starts at 7pm.

New images from the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) reveal never-before-seen details in the planet-forming disc around a nearby Sun-like star, including a tantalising gap at the same distance from the star as the Earth is from the Sun. This structure may mean that an infant version of our home planet, or possibly a more massive “super-Earth,” is beginning to form there.</p> <p>To understand where the Earth comes from, we have to look beyond what's visible to the human eye. Using radio telescopes, we can now ""see"" the raw material for making planets in orbit around young stars and probe the process of planet formation in action. This talk will introduce some basic ideas and open questions about planet formation, starting with properties of our own Solar System that have been known for centuries, and proceeding to the latest advances from the giant international Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) of 66 precision antennas sited at 16,500 feet altitude in northern Chile.</p> <p><br/><img src=""https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/4/9/d/600_466538045.jpeg"" /></p> <p><b>About the speaker<br/></b>David J.

My partners have. They are pursuing off-market deals in major markets and building their portfolios. The key to their success is finding the right partners. They gain confidence, capital, knowledge, financial strength and get rid of fear.</p> <p>I started my journey as a 23 year old and have partners. Now almost 10 years later, I've built a portfolio valued at $7.5mm. My partner has a portfolio of almost 1,400 units (thanks to partners), Ryan from Cushman &amp; Wakefield has access to off-market deals and Robert has access to high net-worth and institutional real estate investors. </p> <p>Just like my group of partners, you can also overcome challenges of lack of capital, weak financial strength, lack of knowledge, gain access to off-market deals, remove fear of failure and inability to take that next step. </p> <p>So far we are doing a great job. Many partners are working on a 10-70 unit deals. Our relationships were leveraged to find off-market deals and help with fund raising (equity and debt). Come and hear their story and see how you can do it!</p> <p>It's an ONLINE webinar on <b>Thursday, December 7th</b> at 9pm EST (8pm Central / 6pm Pacific)</p> <p>Click here now to register for that- <a href=""http://incomepropertiesportfolio.pagedemo.co/""><a href=""http://incomepropertiesportfolio.pagedemo.co/"" class=""linkified"">http://incomepropertiesportfolio.pagedemo.co/</a></a></p>",1.7638750076293943,,https://www.meetup.com/incomepropertiesportfolio-sanfrancisco/events/245257936/,,,,,,,1486591110000,37.77999877929688,-122.41999816894531,22291919,open,Bay Area Multifamily Real Estate Investing Group,incomepropertiesportfolio-sanfrancisco,Investors,0,see details,245257936,0,"SF Multifamily Investing- Partner Up, Raise Capital & Do Deals",,,upcoming,1512698400000,1511200214000,-28800000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,public,0,,17,2017-12-07 20:00:00,4,career/business

Something evil is trapping the souls of the dead and draining life from all who have been raised from death by magic. This worldwide “death curse” not only prevents the raising of the dead but also causes creatures that were previously raised from the dead to wither and die. The source of this death curse lies in a trap-riddled tomb hidden beneath a lost city in the depths of a vast jungle. </p> <p>

Once sacred space is established there is a Giving/Receiving of the Oneness Blessing or Deeksha which is sanskrit for benediction. The blessing is given by Oneness Blessing initiates. They have gone through a training where the energy body is opened to transmit the blessing directly.</p> <p>This Grace is specifically intended to Awaken Humanity. As you receive the grace it has its own intelligence to assist you in your life, to lessen pain at all levels. Come and experience the Grace for yourself.

1509211393000,"<p>In Lisbon in 1904, a young man named Tomás discovers an old journal. It hints at the existence of an extraordinary artifact that—if he can find it—would redefine history. Traveling in one of Europe’s earliest automobiles, he sets out in search of this strange treasure.</p> <p>

Thirty-five years later, a Portuguese pathologist devoted to the murder mysteries of Agatha Christie finds himself at the center of a mystery of his own and drawn into the consequences of Tomás’s quest.</p> <p>

Fifty years on, a Canadian senator takes refuge in his ancestral village in northern Portugal, grieving the loss of his beloved wife. But he arrives with an unusual companion: a chimpanzee. And there the century-old quest will come to an unexpected conclusion.</p> <p>

<i>The High Mountains of Portugal</i></p> <p>—part quest, part ghost story, part contemporary fable—offers a haunting exploration of great love and great loss.

Same time and place, in case you can't make this one.</i><i>*</i></p> <p><b>Hike the Beaver Creek Wetlands Winter Series: Oakes Quarry Park</b> </p> <p>The wetlands are beautiful places in fall and winter. So let's get outside and visit the reserves of the Beaver Creek Wetlands. These places are very important to me and I love to visit them.</p> <p><b>This will be a discovery hike.</b> Pace will not be fast as we will stop frequently to look, take pictures and talk about features of this reserve.</p> <p>We will hike the loop at Cemex Reserve and may go off trail for a little exploring.</p> <p>In this series, we will visit all 11 reserves of the Beaver Creek Wetlands.</p> <p><b>About the Cemex Reserve</b></p> <p>In 1800 this site was likely a prairie wetland with shallow standing water. Farmers drained it and later the land was mined as a source of soils needed for the production of Portland cement. </p> <p>Through a federal grant to Wright State University and the Beaver Creek Wetlands Association, this wetland and prairie were restored in the mid 1990s. Water was diverted back onto the land and original drainage patterns were restored. Plantings have restored native wildflowers, grasses and sedges.</p> <p><img src=""https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/c/1/8/600_430467672.jpeg"" /></p> <p><b>Trail length:</b> About 4.5 miles total </p> <p><br/><b>Trail difficulty:</b> Flat but prepare for mud</p> <p><b>What to see:</b> Marsh, wet forest, wet prairie and small fens. The rare wet prairie naturally floods in late winter and spring then dries in summer to support Indian Grass, Big Bluestem and Little Bluestem grasses. Look also for coneflowers, Monkey Flowers, Ohio Goldenrod, Prairie Dock, Butterfly Weed and other colorful flowers in late summer. In late winter, waterfowl like wood duck and bufflehead may be seen in open water. At other times look for reptiles, amphibians, painted and map turtles, bluebirds, deer and fox.</p> <p><b>Amenities:</b> Cemex Reserve: 165 acres with parking, hiking, wetlands area, portable restrooms (varies)</p> <p><b>Extras:</b> Bring water, camera and binoculars.</p> <p>About the Beaver Creek Wetlands: The Beaver Creek Wetlands encompass over 2000 acres along the Beaver Creek and Little Beaver Creek watershed. The Beaver Creek Wetlands were preserved through a community partnership that encourages the restoration of wetland and traditional upland habitats, such as forests and prairies. The wetlands are managed by the Beaver Creek Wetlands Association, a non-profit land trust that promotes the use of these protected areas for education, research and recreation. <a href=""http://www.beavercreekwetlands.org/"">www.beavercreekwetlands.org</a></p> <p><b>Links</b> </p> <p><a href=""http://beavercreekwetlands.org/maplocations-cemex.html"">Cemex Reserve</a></p> <p><b>Pet Policy: Please leave pets at home.

Husk - Greenville is located in the historic West End—just a few blocks from the Reedy River, in the heart of Downtown Greenville. It is the third outpost of the Neighborhood Dining Group and James Beard Award-winning Chef Sean Brock’s renowned restaurant, Husk. Led by Brock and Chef de Cuisine Jon Buck, the kitchen reinterprets the bounty of the surrounding area, exploring an ingredient-driven cuisine that begins in the rediscovery of heirloom products and redefines what it means to cook and eat in Greenville.</p> <p>At Husk - Greenville, there are some rules about what can go on the plate – if it doesn’t come from the South, it’s not coming through the door. The restaurant is as casual as it is chic, evoking a way of life centered on seasonality and respect for an area's agriculture and cuisine. It is a neighborhood gathering place for friends, and a destination dining spot for travelers, with a little bite of the South for everyone’s palates.</p> <p>Their menu changes daily, but they will have options for those with dietary restrictions, such as vegetarian or gluten free.

Please try act in a sportsman like manner. Respect your fellow players. It is just a game. <i>No attitudes. Always go 110% but remember to play nice, share, and focus on the development of friendships rather than egos. We succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed.</i></p> <p><b>Contact Event Organizer to Confirm Skill Level BEFORE signing up<br/></b></p> <p>Any new member wishing to play at a BB level event <b>MUST</b> contact the Event Organizer <b>BEFORE</b> signing up to confirm their experience and skill set. This includes any current member who wishes to move up to the BB level. In your profile or by e-mail, please describe your sand volleyball experience and your skill level and in particular if you have played 4's, 3's or 2's in an organized setting. If you were referred by another member who can vouch for your skill level, please specify who. The event organizer may require that you first be observed to confirm your ability to play. <b>If you sign up for your first event without contacting the event organizer, your RSVP will be removed.</b> If you do not agree with the level that you are placed at, you are more than welcome to find another group to play at your desired level.</p> <p>If you are unsure of your level, please email me.</p> <p>As a courtesy to those signing up -- <b>ONLY</b> those signing up are guaranteed a spot to play. If you do not sign up or you are on the waiting list, but show up you will not play unless there is an open spot, e.g. someone leaves or volunteers / shares their spot.</p> <p><b>This event is for BB level and above</b>.</p> <p>BB Level (high intermediate) description</p> <p>This level is for skilled players who are at the upper end of Intermediate and are more consistent with their skills. Players can control the ball more consistently and are aware and capable of passing, setting and spiking and play 3 hit volleyball at all times. This is for players close to being at the advanced level but needing to improve their consistency and strategy. Players at this level have a good understanding of the rules, and be proficient at all of the skills required. Ability to control the ball and passing, setting and spiking is done on a more consistent basis. Players are strong defensively and able to dig balls.</p> <p>If you feel a player is signed up for a level above their skills, please notify me. All information will remain confidential and I or one of the other organizers will watch the player to see if they are playing at a meet up that matches their level.</p> <p><b>No Shows and Late Bail Outs</b></p> <p>No-shows and late bail outs hurt the group. A ""no-show"" is when you RSVP 'YES' for an event but fail to attend it. Any RSVP change less than 12 hours before an event is considered to be a "" late bail out"". Volleyball is a team sport. Be a team player. If you are not going to be able to attend please update your RSVP more than 12 hours before the event and let someone else have your spot. Think of it as your responsibility to the team. <b>Individuals with three (3)</b> <b>no-shows or (3) late bail outs (in any combination) will be removed from the group. No conversation, no warning and no exceptions.</b></p> <p><b>Guests</b></p> <p>Past experience shows that guests often do not show up for events. To avoid this, in general to sign up for a volleyball event, you must be a member of the Atlanta Volleyball Meetup group. Exceptions may be made on a case by case basis – please contact the event organizer.</p> <p><b>Rules</b></p> <p>The Rules that we will be playing by are:<br/>1. No open handed passing<br/>2. No carries (that includes open handed dinks or ""indoor dinks"")<br/>3. No hand setting over the net<br/>4. No double contact (a player contacts the ball twice in succession or the ball contacts<br/>various parts of the player’s body successively)<br/>5. No hitting the net<br/>6. No illegal sets. The ball must be contacted cleanly and not held (including lifted, pushed, caught, carried or thrown). The ball cannot spin when you set it. Anything more than a 3/4 turn of the ball, is counted as an illegal set. Note: there is a common misconception that hand sets can be judged based on the number of rotations by the ball in the air. However, rotation of a set ball may indicate a held ball or multiple contacts during the set but in itself is not a fault.</p> <p><br/><b>Rally Scoring</b></p> <p>All games are played by rally scoring. This means every mistake is a point for the other team. If you miss a serve, miss a hit, or miss a block, the other team gets a point.</p> <p><br/><b>Location</b></p> <p>One sand court at Don White Memorial Park. About a quarter mile east of Highway 9 and Riverside Park. The exact location of the court is few dozen yards south of Riverside Road and further west from the the bridge than is indicated by the push pin on the Google Map that was auto generated.</p> <p><b>Feedback</b></p> <p>If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, complaints - please drop me a line and I would be more than happy to address the situation. Your feedback on how to improve this meetup is encouraged and appreciated.</p> <p>Welcome and see you in the sand.</p> <p>This event is for Adults... age 18 and up.</p>",23.81482124328613,12600000.0,https://www.meetup.com/AtlantaVolleyball/events/245442793/,,,,,,,1182813892000,33.939998626708984,-84.31999969482422,538419,open,Atlanta Volleyball Meetup Group,AtlantaVolleyball,Volleyball players,0,,jchtdnywqbmb,0,3's High Intermediate ( BB Level) Sand Volleyball - (11 am -  2:30pm ),,12.0,upcoming,1512835200000,1497990514000,-18000000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,public,0,,6,2017-12-09 10:00:00,6,sports/recreation

Philosopher, writer and journalist, he’s notably famous for his political positions and his texts on absurdism and existentialism.</p> <p>During this event, Jean-Paul Schintu will perform his adaptation of the last Albert Camus’ novel The First Man.<br/>Jean-Paul Schintu is a French actor and stage director. Former student of the National Conservatory of Dramatic Art, he has performed in more than 60 plays, both classical (Molière, Musset, Maupassant) and contemporary (Sarraute, Ionesco, Claudel) in France and abroad.</p> <p>When Camus died in 1960, he was working on the “The First Man”. The manuscript was found in his bath towel at the accident site. At that time, his wife and friends decided not to publish the unfinished novel. The text publication came out in 1994.</p> <p>The book is an autobiographical novel written in third person. Usually reticent to talk about himself, Camus explicitly sets out on a pilgrimage to his past and to his private world. This novel addresses the absence of his father.</p> <p>Camus also pays tribute to the Algeria of his childhood to which he is deeply attached. This homage was far from insignificant during the Algerian war [masked]). Albert Camus’ moderate position on this conflict was decried. The correct stance at the time was indeed to support the Algerian independence movement.</p> <p>Jean-Paul Schintu will present his own interpretation of the novel in highlighting the most important excerpts such as the search of the father, the intense relation with his mother, the colonialism damages, and the difficulties to write during the Algerian conflict.</p> <p>Come enjoy a great play on December 7th, at the Alliance Francaise of San Francisco, 1345 Bush Street.<br/>$24, $19 for members.</p> <p>Get your tickets here!<br/><a href=""https://www.eventbrite.com/e/camus-the-first-man-played-by-jean-paul-shintu-tickets-38672483439"" class=""linkified"">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/camus-the-first-man-played-by-jean-paul-shintu-tickets-38672483439</a></p>",24.246267318725586,,https://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-French-Language-and-Culture-Lovers/events/244264022/,,,,,,,1487718550000,37.77999877929688,-122.41999816894531,22505604,open,San Francisco French Language and Culture Lovers,San-Francisco-French-Language-and-Culture-Lovers,Members,0,,244264022,0,"Camus : The First Man, played by Jean-Paul Shintu",,,upcoming,1512702000000,1508193958000,-28800000,1345 Bush Street,,,San Francisco,us,25077458.0,0.0,USA,0.0,Alliance Francaise de San francisco ,,False,CA,,public,0,,5,2017-12-07 21:00:00,4,language/ethnic identity

This is yet another carefully ridden ride from the ever growing, fun loving riders of SWFL Critical Mass. The ride rolling speed is just 8 to 10 mph, it is not a race, it is a fun social ride.

NE-Lee here we come! </p> <p>Here are the SWFL Critical Mass ride guidelines: </p> <p>1. ALL riders ride at their own risk. You are responsible for your self, and just like any vehicle on the road, riding with care and caution. We announce the ride, come ride along, meet new friends, enjoy the sights and sounds. </p> <p>2. Be nice, nice works!

Movie starts at 7:15, we will meet at 7 pm at the theatre. We will pick somewhere to eat/drink in the area after.</p> <p>...</p> <p>“The Room” is the subject of the upcoming James Franco comedy “The Disaster Artist”, where Room co-star Greg Sestero (played by James’s brother Dave) chronicles his adventures with the eccentric and quirky Wiseau (James Franco) inside and outside of the making of the destined cult classic.</p> <p>Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero become friends after meeting each other in an acting class in San Francisco. Hoping to achieve Hollywood stardom, Sestero moves to Los Angeles and signs on to appear in his buddy's project. Financed with his own money, Wiseau writes, directs and stars in ""The Room,"" a critically maligned movie that becomes a cult classic. ""The Room"" synopsis below.</p> <p>...</p> <p>In 2003, then-aspiring actor Tommy Wiseau financed, created, directed, and starred in a movie entitled “The Room”, which he has describes as “a film with the passion of Tennessee Williams.” “The Room” tells the story of Johnny, a San Francisco banker played by Wiseau, whose fiancé Lisa is having an affair with his best friend Mark. Along the way, the movie is plagued by bad acting, questionable casting, awful dialogue, poor camera work, continuity issues, “budgeted” settings, and baffling wardrobe choices to name a few. But Wiseau was undeterred. He was determined to unleash his vision to the world.</p> <p>In its opening week, The Room’s wide release barely grossed 4 figures in ticket sales and was universally panned. One reviewer said, “This film is like getting stabbed in the head.” Another called it “The Citizen Kane of bad movies.” However, with the help of a couple of movie critics in attendance, word of the entertainingly bad movie came out, and crowds in Los Angeles started to flock to these screenings. Over time, Wiseau’s futility became the selling point of bringing in the worldwide masses to see The Room, to witness a movie so bad, it has to be seen to be believed.</p> <p>Even to this day, The Room enjoys a cult following that is often compared to The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Moviegoers regularly pack screenings worldwide to not only watch The Room, but to turn it into an interactive experience. They howl in laughter at bad acting, yell along with brilliant lines like “YOU’RE TEARING ME APART LISA!”, and throw footballs and plastic spoons in the air during key scenes. After 14 years, The Room and Wiseau have achieved success in the most unlikely of paths and is set to do so for years to come.</p> <p>Thanks to Chris Matthews for this idea and helping me to arrange this!</p>",18.355546951293945,14400000.0,https://www.meetup.com/AtlantaCircleOfFriends/events/245596094/,,,,,,,1506896690000,33.860000610351555,-84.4000015258789,26118924,approval,Atlanta Circle of Friends,AtlantaCircleOfFriends,Members,0,In front of the theater,245596094,0,"Movie: ""The Disaster Artist""",,,upcoming,1512777600000,1512567264000,-18000000,3500 Peachtree Road Northeast,,,Atlanta,US,25644341.0,33.852852,USA,-84.362267,AMC Phipps Plaza 14,,False,,,public,0,,7,2017-12-08 18:00:00,5,outdoors/adventure
